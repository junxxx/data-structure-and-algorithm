## tree

### binary search tree 
A binary tree is a tree in which no node can have more than two children.
### AVL tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis)
The heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one;
if at any time they differ by more than one,rebalancing is done to restore this property.
### tree rotation
tree rotation is an operation on a binary tree that changes the structure 
without interfering with the order of the elements. 
A tree rotation moves one node up in the tree and one node down.
